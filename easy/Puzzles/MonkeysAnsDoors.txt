If the no of divisors of a particular number is even the door closes else the door is open
for each number divisors comes in pairs
example:
6
1*6=6
2*3=6

but in case of perfect squares one divisor repeats hences making it odd and keeping the door open
example:
4
1*4=4
2*2=4
no of unique divisors are 3

hence 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100 total 10 doors are open
